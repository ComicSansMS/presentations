Safety-First: Understanding How To Develop Safety-critical Software

Safety-critical software is becoming increasingly visible as a target domain for C++. But what does it actually mean to develop for a safety-critical system? You may have heard wild stories about safety-certified compilers and MISRA conformance checks, but how does that help making software more safe? What does it even mean to be safe? In this talk we will try to shed some lights on the driving factors behind safety-critical development: Gain an understanding of the fundamental principles for reasoning about safety and delve deeply into the implications for day to day software development. We will get you into the mindset of a safety engineer and help you understand both the "how?" and "why?" of common safety engineering practices. Using the ISO standard for functional safety in automotive systems as a starting point, we will illustrate the conceptual models of safety and what the effects of those are on a C++ codebase implementing safety-critical functionalities. In the end, you will hopefully get a better understanding for the needs of developers working in safety-critical domains, and why they sometimes seem at odds with those of ordinary application developers. And how despite the different means being employed, in the end we all are striving for the same goal of writing well-engineered, high quality software. 


Comments:
This talk will be similar in spirit to talks like Michael Wong's CppCon 2019 presentation on safety-critical software, but specifically targeted at the CppNow audience of highly experienced C++ developers with only a vague background in safety. The goal is really to give people a better understanding for the often seemingly strange demands from safety people and help them understand the underlying mindset that drives development in such projects. Especially in light of the increasing attention to concerns from safety people in the ISO C++ committee (eg. P2026), this talk aims to build a bridge of understanding for C++ experts to the safety community. 

Outline:
 * What is Safety? When do we consider software to be "safe". Difference between safe and bug-free.
 * A tour of the ISO-26262 standard. This will mostly be about development processes, but it is an important building block to understand the effects on software development
 * Where safety-critical development differs from ordinary development. And where it doesn't.
 * A critical look at common practices from the safety community and how they relate to the current understanding of best practices in the C++ community
 * A discussion of the fitness of C++ for safety-critical development compared to other languages like C, Ada or Rust
 * Possible future directions for C++ to better support safety use cases

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Partial correctness - the program does not produce the wrong answer \cpause

  \item Risk - Probability of the occurrence of harm weighted by the severity \cpause
  \item Unreasonable risk - Unacceptable according to societal moral concepts \cpause
  \item Safety - Absence of unreasonable risk
  \end{itemize}

  \note{
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Definition of harm is very specific for automotive; what would be the definition harm for bitcoin? for instagram? for a video game with in-game purchases? these are just the most obvious examples

  \frametitle{What is functional safety?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Electric/electronic systems can fail for various reasons.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Systematic faults - Deterministic, need to be prevented by design measures
    \item Random hardware failure - Unpredictable failures that follow a probability distribution
  \end{itemize} \cpause
  \item Functional safety wants to reduce the \emph{risk} resulting from such faults \cpause
  \item Note that preventing the fault is just one way to achieve this!
  \end{itemize}
  
  \note{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item In 26262, "systematic faults are due to design or specification issues"
    \item Fault - Abnormal condition that can an item to fail
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Permanent, intermittent (from time to time and then disappears; could be on the verge of breaking) or transient (once and never again, e.g. bit-flip)
